## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt a lot working with html markup and css, getting used to their tags and class properties while writing this project, I indeed learnt how to use flex property and the absolute positioning to a good extent. I have alot more to learn in css though as I am growing further in th field. I really have alot to learn on javascrript as it is very important in the process

Working on this project was realling challenging as the project had a lot to do with images and their alignments. I faced alot of challenges but I got solution to few by researching on stackoverflow, w3schools and the general solutions found on google. 

### Continued development

I strongly look forward to work more on css positioning, grid, icons, animations and media query. And I look forward to reallu understanding the basic concept of (JavaScript and React) and its utilizations.

### Useful resources
